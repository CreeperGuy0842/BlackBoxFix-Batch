# üñ•Ô∏è Windows Black Box Fix (.bat)

This is a simple batch script that fixes the black box issue on Windows desktop icons by clearing the thumbnail cache and restarting Explorer.

## Features
- Auto-runs as Administrator (prompts if not elevated)  
- Kills and restarts `explorer.exe` safely  
- Deletes all thumbnail cache (`iconcache*.db`) files (including subfolders)
- Shows success or error messages depending on deletion results  

## Usage
- Download the .bat file [here]([https://example.com](https://github.com/CreeperGuy0842/BlackBoxFix-Batch/releases)).
- Right-click ‚Üí Run as administrator (if not auto-elevated).
- Wait until Explorer restarts.
- Black boxes on icons should now be gone.

##  Notes

- Safe to run multiple times if needed.
- Two options are provided: Admin and User versions.
  - *Admin* version is recommended.
  - `User` version may not work reliably.
